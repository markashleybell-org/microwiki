I needed a really simple ASP.NET Wiki app which I could dump onto an IIS server and have it *just work*. Everything else I've tried is either hugely overengineered, takes an age to start up from 'cold' or is just plain difficult and confusing to use. So rather than sit here complaining about it, I'm building something which meets my needs.
