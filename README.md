# MicroWiki

A super-simple, lightweight wiki application, running on .NET Core 3.1.

## IIS Deployment

The app can be deployed as a self-contained app, but hosting under IIS requires the [.NET Core Windows Hosting Bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-aspnetcore-3.1.0-windows-hosting-bundle-installer).
